# shitty fucking website

HELLo welcome to my repo for website

You must access it through http://lowes.qzz.io/. Don't ask why, it only works on that.

## how to access the content library

<p>ts is broken, here's how to use it correctly:<br/>go to Actions on the repo, then click on the newest action that's been run. go to the deploy job, then "List dist contents." copy the file name (for example, akuma-Bm688GeS.html), and use it in this format: http://lowes.qzz.io/assets/[the filename you found]<br/>there, that should be a workaround until my dumbass finds a fix</p>
